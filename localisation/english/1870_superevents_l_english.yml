 SuperEvent_FPW:0 "Franco-Prussian War!"
 SuperEvent_FPW_DESCRIPTION:0 "In a startling development, the long-standing tensions between France and Prussia have erupted into open warfare. The declaration of hostilities, made official by Emperor Napoleon III of France, marks the beginning of what is anticipated to be a momentous and far-reaching conflict.\n\nThe immediate cause of the war has been traced to the diplomatic fallout over the Ems Dispatch, a controversial communication that further strained relations between the two nations. France's abrupt decision to engage militarily follows mounting frustrations over Prussian ambitions and the recent Spanish succession crisis.\n\nPrussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck has swiftly mobilized his well-equipped forces, deploying them with strategic precision. The Prussian military's reputation for organization and effectiveness is expected to play a crucial role in the early stages of the war."

 SuperEvent_BCW:0 "English Civil War!"
 SuperEvent_BCW_DESCRIPTION:0 "This morning several trade unions under the influence of George Odger, President of the Internationale, have risen up in defiance against the government in London. Specifically, regions in the north such as Lancashire and Yorkshire have declared their support for the revolutionaries and seized land from many well known businessmen. \n\nThis crisis erupted after months of continuous strikes and attempts to disrupt Parliament's hearings on new legislation, most likely caused due to Queen Victoria's sudden call for an Order in Council whereby she attempted to co-rule with a Prime Minister of her own choosing, undermining the democratic government.\n\nAfter this shocking development, several former colonies of Britain issued independence declarations, seemingly in disapproval of their unstable overlord.

 SuperEvent_BW:0 "Civil War in Japan!"
 SuperEvent_BW_DESCRIPTION:0 "Imperial forces in Japan have risen up against the Tokugawa Shogunate with significant support from many domains across the country. Despite lacking in numbers their few modernised units have proven effective so far, and alongside the fact that the Shogun's forces appear disorganised and led by disgruntled officers, it could mean the end of the Tokugawa Clan's 300 year rule.\n\nTensions had been rising throughout the past few decades, stemming from the Shogunate's poor management especially regarding the influence of foreign nations. This, combined with Yoshinobu's refusal to transfer military power towards the Emperor, has caused an all-out civil war to erupt between the Imperial and Shogun forces."
