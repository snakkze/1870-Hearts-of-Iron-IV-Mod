 fpw_AUS_hungarian_seperatism_desc:0 "Since the failed Hungarian revolution of 1848, irredentism in Hungary has steadily increased.

 fpw_AUS_stagnant_economy_desc:0 "The industrialisation of Iron, Textiles and Coal allowed Austria to outproduce the other German states in the early 1800's, and experience a luxerious economic growth. Since then, however, a period of economic stagnation has occured, largely caused by military defeats against the Prussians and the loss of the resource-rich Silesian lands. The economy has thus ground to a halt, allowing the Prussians to overtake our productivity."
 fpw_AUS_progressive_education:0 "Progressive Education"
 fpw_AUS_progressive_education_desc:0 "Austrian Literacy became one of the highest in the Habsburg realm following education reforms which saw compulsory education for both boys and girls."
 fpw_AUS_diverse_military:0 "Diverse Military"
 fpw_AUS_diverse_military_desc:0 "Through the foundation of the common army, an army now exists that serves both Austrians and Hungarians.\nHowever, with the massive amount of ethnicities within the Austrian realm, it will be largely impossible to make amends for this."
