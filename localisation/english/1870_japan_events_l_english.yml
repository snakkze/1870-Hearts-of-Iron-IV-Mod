These influential figures possess considerable power and have their own visions for Japan's future. The Emperor symbolizes the unity and spiritual authority of the nation, but his authority is underpinned by the very men who helped him ascend to power. The Genrō, the elder statesmen of our new regime, with their experience in both governance and warfare, advocate for rapid modernization and Westernization, believing that this is the only path to secure Japan’s place among the great powers. Attempting to centralize power under the Emperor could lead to internal resistance because of these influential men.
