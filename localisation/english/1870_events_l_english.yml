  ## Romania Events

  fpw_romania.1.t:0 "The Current State of the Industry"
  fpw_romania.1.d:0 "The current state of affairs regarding our industry is deplorable. Our factories are operating well below capacity, and our production efficiency is abysmally low. Our work norms are outdated and inefficient, leaving us far behind our competitors on the global stage. The Ottoman Empire, in its relentless pursuit of dominance, is siphoning off our resources, further crippling our already weakened industrial capabilities. This exploitation cannot continue unchecked if we hope to secure a prosperous future for our nation."

  fpw_romania.2.d:0 "After extensive brainstorming, we have come up with two possible solutions to address the budget issue. First, we could allocate a significant amount of funds to boost the education sector. This approach would greatly enhance the quality and reach of education but requires considerable resources and may strain our overall budget, potentially crippling other essential sectors. Alternatively, we could allocate only the bare minimum necessary to maintain the education sector. This would result in a weaker and less effective department but would allow us to conserve resources and maintain a more balanced budget overall. What should we do?"
