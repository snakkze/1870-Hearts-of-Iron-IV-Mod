Bismarck still says we shouldn't take too much because if we do, the relations with not only [FRA.GetName] but also the international community will worsen to a point.

This exploitation cannot continue unchecked if we hope to secure a prosperous future for our nation."

Alternatively, we could allocate only the bare minimum necessary to maintain the education sector. This would result in a weaker and less effective department but would allow us to conserve resources and maintain a more balanced budget overall. What should we do?"
